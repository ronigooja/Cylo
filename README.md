# Zoe

Zoe is a private, self-hosted AI first mate, named after Zoë Washburne, Captain Malcolm Reynolds's second-in-command in *Firefly*. See [product positioning](docs/product.md#1-product-positioning) for the role this name expresses.

The system has a Linux control plane, independent runner, and native macOS, iPhone, and iPad clients. Implementation is underway; no product milestone has been accepted.

Choose a starting point:

- [Product requirements](docs/product.md): scope, user journeys, interaction rules, and exclusions.
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md): components, authority, data flows, and [decisions](docs/architecture/decisions/).
- [Delivery plan](docs/master-plan.md): milestones, current status, blockers, and acceptance gates.
- [Deployment operations](docs/operations/deployment.md): installation, configuration, maintenance, and Zoe OpenCode runtime uncertainty reconciliation.
- [Data lifecycle](docs/operations/data-lifecycle.md): export, backup, restore, migration, and deletion.
- [Acceptance matrix](docs/acceptance/requirements.md) and [evidence](docs/acceptance/evidence.md): coverage, verification boundaries, and remaining gaps.
- [Approved native assistant reference](docs/design/native-assistant-reference.png): current visual direction.
- [CI verification](docs/development/verification.md): change scope, hosted checks, and manual artifact generation.
