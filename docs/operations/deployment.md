# Deployment operations

This runbook describes the local Linux installation and the macOS client on
`zhuwei@macair`. For the distinction between documentation and acceptance, see
the [evidence register](../acceptance/evidence.md).

For client error investigation, authenticated diagnostic uploads, bounded
SQLite inspection, and voice pool isolation checks, see the
[client diagnostics runbook](diagnostics.md).

## Linux services and storage

- `/opt/zoe/releases/current` selects the immutable server/runner release.
- `zoe-compose.service` supervises the server, memory worker, and Qdrant.
- `zoe-runner.service` runs the trusted execution runner.
- `zoe-macair-tunnel.service` maintains private SSH forwarding to the Mac.
- `/etc/zoe` contains deployment configuration and secret references.
- `/var/lib/zoe` contains authority databases and persistent service data.

The operator classifies a host with an absolute `ZOE_COMPOSE_FILE` (including
the standard `zoe-compose.service` systemd wrapper) as a managed Compose
deployment. Systemd supervises the Compose process; it does not select the
OpenCode runtime path. Keep `provider-deployment.json` consistent with
this layout or let the operator rediscover the mode from `zoe-stack.env`.

The installer creates the external Docker network `zoe` when it is missing. The
existing remote CLIProxyAPI deployment remains outside Zoe's lifecycle.

Voice account-pool behavior and the fail-closed media boundary are defined in
[ADR 0005](../architecture/decisions/0005-voice-task-and-lease-boundaries.md).
Keep `ZOE_VOICE_ACCOUNT_MEDIA_ENABLED` disabled unless a separately reviewed
gateway release implements the required lease contract.

`ZOE_VOICE_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 60, clamped to 30–600) controls
server-side voice reaping: active sessions with no recent heartbeat are reclaimed
through the normal release flow; unverified termination remains quarantined and
keeps the voice pool blocked.

Check service status without printing environment files or secret values:

```bash
systemctl is-active zoe-compose zoe-runner zoe-macair-tunnel
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8787/healthz
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8787/readyz
```

The previously recorded installation binds port 8787 on both host loopback and the authorized
LAN interface. For deployments exposing the LAN interface, the address is deployment-specific
and must be supplied as the numeric `ZOE_SERVER_LAN_ADDRESS` value in the host environment.
An address change while the service is already running requires restarting the Zoe service to
republish it.
The deployment override `/etc/zoe/control.lan.compose.yaml` adds this binding;
`/etc/systemd/system/zoe-compose.service.d/lan.conf` includes the override in
the service's Compose commands. The source template is
`deploy/linux/docker-compose.lan.yml`; set `ZOE_SERVER_LAN_ADDRESS` to the
host LAN address. Update that setting if the host address changes.
OpenCode runs only in runner-created containers. The provider bridge/socket is the only runtime egress; health/readiness responses do not prove model execution, memory processing, or task completion.

## Installation and configuration

Use the [Linux deployment templates](../../deploy/linux/) and [release workflow](../../.github/workflows/server-release.yml) for the server/runner release. The reviewed release must contain `bin/zoe-secret-entrypoint` and `deploy-linux/` with the Compose and systemd files. Do not compile on the control host.

The operator release installation procedure below installs only the maintenance CLI. It does not install server images or configure a complete deployment. Run `zoe status` before `zoe setup`, `zoe provider configure`, `zoe provider test`, `zoe memory configure`, or `zoe memory test`; these operations are also available from the grouped interactive menu. The memory model key is a separate credential issued by the model gateway and entered through `zoe`; Zoe never creates it. For an already deployed external voice gateway, use `zoe voice configure --url HTTPS_URL --token-file PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`, then `zoe voice test` and `zoe voice status`. This writes only the Zoe-side endpoint and secret reference; it does not deploy or modify the gateway. Follow [the CLI implementation](../../cmd/zoe/) for current flags and [deployment configuration](../../internal/ops/deployment_config.go) for detection and rollback behavior.

### Complete Linux deployment order

Copy the reviewed `zoe-linux-<arch>.tar.gz` package to the host, then run the
single bootstrap entry point:

```sh
sudo bash deploy-linux/install-cli.sh /path/to/zoe-linux-<arch>.tar.gz
sudo zoe install [--start] --release /path/to/release \
  --opencode-image ghcr.io/OWNER/zoe-opencode:TAG@sha256:DIGEST
```

   The bootstrap verifies `SHA256SUMS`, installs the CLI atomically, and keeps one
   immutable CLI release. `zoe install` validates the release and host before
   writing files, stages the release, pins images by digest, pulls them, installs
   the systemd units, preserves existing tokens and operator environment keys, and creates
   deployment-owned runner tokens only when absent. It does not create an instance
   key or a model gateway key. It leaves services stopped by default; `--start`
   starts both units and waits for the health probe. It prints the next steps in
   order: `zoe key init`, `zoe memory configure`, then `zoe provider configure` for
   systemd/runner deployments. Until key init, `zoe status` shows
   `Instance key: pending (run zoe key init)`. Provider and memory keys come from
   the model gateway and are entered through `zoe`; they are never generated here.

After the stack starts, steps 1 and 2 may be done in either order; step 3 comes last:

1. Run `zoe key init --database PATH --server HTTPS_URL --output PRIVATE_JSON`
   (or `zoe key rotate` for an existing instance). The operator keeps the private
   JSON output for client connection. The server uses the credential hash stored
   in its database; the installer must not create, inject, or persist a plaintext
   instance-key startup secret. When root creates the database before the Compose
   service has, set ownership of the database and any existing `-wal` and `-shm`
   sidecars to `65532:65532`, retaining mode `0600`. Do not recursively change
   the directory's private JSON exports.
2. Configure the memory model with `zoe memory configure`, then configure the
   task model with `zoe provider configure` for systemd/runner deployments.
3. Verify service state, `/healthz`, and `/readyz`. `/healthz` establishes process
   liveness; `/readyz` is `200 {"status":"ready"}` only after the instance-auth
   row exists and otherwise remains `503` pending. These checks establish
   installation and process readiness; model execution, memory processing, and
   end-to-end task completion require a separate acceptance run.

The complete host installation therefore includes the Zoe-owned OpenCode runtime image,
Zoe server image, trusted runner, memory worker image, Qdrant service, Docker,
and the three Zoe systemd services. An external model gateway is not installed
by this procedure. Its URL, selected model, and API-key file are deployment
configuration applied to the OpenCode runtime and memory worker after the host components
are installed; leaving them unset keeps the daemons available but prevents
model-backed task execution.

### Upgrade and removal

Use `zoe update --release /path/to/release --opencode-image ...` to stage and pull
the new release, switch `current`, restart Compose and the runner, and verify
health. Update refreshes release-owned environment keys, including image
references and paths derived from the configured roots, while preserving
operator-owned keys and unknown lines. A failed update restores the prior
selector and environment files byte-for-byte and reports the failing command's
bounded output; data and secrets are not touched.
Use `zoe uninstall` for reviewed removal. It
first prints the exact Compose-project containers, `io.zoe.managed=true` runtime
containers, and local IDs for the four Zoe image repositories. It removes the
Compose project with `docker compose down --remove-orphans`, removes only those
queried IDs, keeps the shared Qdrant image, and never runs Docker prune. It
requires typing `yes` unless `--yes` is supplied; non-interactive use must supply
`--yes`. By default it keeps `/var/lib/zoe` and all `/etc/zoe`. Add `--purge-data`
to remove data and Zoe-generated configuration/tokens while explicitly keeping
the three gateway credentials; add `--purge-credentials` to remove those too.
It removes `/opt/zoe`, including the installed CLI and all releases, only after
service, container, image, network, and systemd cleanup. If a step fails it
reports completed work and leaves the release root for recovery; rerun
`zoe uninstall` after fixing the failed step. A later install then needs a fresh
operator package.

## Server and worker settings

The Linux control server reads deployment settings from its process environment. Follow the repository's [credential handling rule](../../AGENTS.md) for deployment-managed secrets; the server does not print them. Bind to loopback or a private trusted interface and put external TLS termination behind the deployment's authenticated network boundary.

The supported runtime image is the pinned Zoe-owned OpenCode image under `deploy/linux/second-runtime/opencode`. Configure `ZOE_OPENCODE_IMAGE`, `ZOE_OPENCODE_MODEL`, `ZOE_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`, `ZOE_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_KEY_FILE`, and `ZOE_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_SOCKET` in the runner environment. CLIProxyAPI remains external and unchanged.

### Configure the OpenCode runtime

The runner creates one OpenCode session per container. Runtime profiles select the OpenCode provider/model route; clients cannot override execution routes or grants.

The workspace path must be absolute, private, and available to the runner-created container.



A missing or invalid workspace fails closed even when server and runner health checks pass. Do not share a workspace across concurrent runs without an explicit ownership grant.

Required settings:

- `ZOE_DATABASE_PATH`: path to the SQLite database. The server acquires a single-writer process lock before opening it.
- The operator initializes or rotates the instance credential with `zoe key init --database PATH --server https://... [--output PRIVATE_JSON]` or `zoe key rotate ...`. The command displays the key and installation link once (and renders a terminal QR using its built-in encoder). The deployment must not generate, inject, or persist a plaintext startup credential; the server authenticates against the database hash. `ZOE_BOOTSTRAP_CODE` is removed; use a fresh database for a new deployment. An ordinary service restart or container recreation does not generate or rotate an instance key. After an explicit `key rotate`, import the newly exported private key into every client before reconnecting; clients retaining the prior key receive an authentication failure.

Optional settings:

- `ZOE_LISTEN_ADDR`: defaults to `127.0.0.1:8787`.
- `ZOE_DEFAULT_PROFILE_ID`: the server-selected profile for new tasks.
- `ZOE_RUNTIME_PROFILES`: JSON object keyed by profile ID. Install writes a working single `worker` profile by default and never overwrites an existing non-empty value. Each profile sets `id`, `runtime_route_id`, `model_route_id`, `role`, `isolation_policy`, `capability_ids`, and `scopes`. Client requests cannot override these execution routes or grants.
- `ZOE_RUNNER_TOKEN`: deployment-provisioned 32-byte base64url runner credential. When set, `ZOE_RUNNER_ID`, `ZOE_RUNNER_WORKSPACES`, and `ZOE_RUNNER_SCOPES` default to `configured-runner`, `default`, and `runner:claim,runner:observe,runner:control:read`.
- `ZOE_MEMORY_RUNNER_TOKEN_FILE`: optional path to a deployment-managed file containing a distinct 32-byte base64url memory worker credential. When enabled, `ZOE_MEMORY_RUNNER_WORKSPACES` must list exact workspace IDs; `ZOE_MEMORY_RUNNER_ID` defaults to `memory-worker`; and `ZOE_MEMORY_RUNNER_SCOPES` may only contain exactly `memory:jobs:claim,memory:jobs:complete,memory:propose`. The server stores only the credential hash and never logs the token. This credential exposes the durable derived-job API; it does not enable a Mem0 or Qdrant runtime.
- Memory-worker deployment also requires `ZOE_CONTROL_URL`, the scoped worker credential injected as `ZOE_RUNNER_TOKEN` (provisioned for the server through `ZOE_MEMORY_RUNNER_TOKEN_FILE`), `ZOE_MEM0_LLM_MODEL`, `ZOE_MEM0_LLM_BASE_URL`, and `ZOE_MEM0_LLM_API_KEY` from deployment-managed secret references. Configure the three Mem0 values with `zoe memory configure`; its secret path must remain distinct from the task-model credential. The memory model key is a separate credential issued by the model gateway and entered through `zoe`, never created by Zoe. `ZOE_MEM0_LLM_PROVIDER` must use the accounted `openai` path; `ollama` is rejected until it supports the same accounting boundary; `ZOE_MEM0_HISTORY_DB` and the model cache belong on the private persistent memory volume. Qdrant URL, optional API-key reference, collection/codec, and worker batch/poll settings are deployment configuration. The pinned multilingual embedding revision and dimensions are defined in [worker configuration](../../services/memory/config.py); changing them requires a separate collection and rebuild.
- For local execution, start the worker from the repository root with `python -m services.memory.worker`, or deploy reviewed CI-built worker images with the settings above. The Compose Qdrant service is loopback-bound and disposable; it is not a production persistence configuration. These commands describe source setup and do not establish production installation or recovery.
- `ZOE_INSTANCE_SCOPES`: comma-separated fixed-owner grants. An explicit value replaces the defaults exactly; it never adds a wildcard or restores omitted grants. Device approval/revocation scopes are not part of the client model. Project/task memory scopes must name their exact scope IDs.

## Fresh-instance operator commands

Stop the server before `zoe key init --database PATH --output PRIVATE_JSON --server URL` or `zoe key rotate --database PATH --output NEW_PRIVATE_JSON --server URL`. Output files must be new private destinations. For legacy deployments, remove instance-key startup variables, secret-entrypoint mappings, and instance-key mounts before maintenance; leave runner and worker credentials in place. The canonical server restarts against its database hash after rotation and requires no plaintext key synchronization. Keep generated keys and installation links out of logs and chat.

Data export and destruction procedures are in [data lifecycle operations](data-lifecycle.md).

## Zoe runtime uncertainty reconciliation

Unknown create outcomes keep their execution slots and must never be retried as
new OpenCode container creates. The operator command changes authority only through the normal
runner observation API; it does not delete journal rows, task/run history, or
container records.

Use a runner built from the same reviewed source as the control server. Stop `zoe-runner` to hold the deployment and journal locks, then inspect Docker by the exact labels `io.zoe.managed=true`, `io.zoe.runtime=opencode`, `io.zoe.run`, `io.zoe.attempt`, and `io.zoe.fence`. Compare two complete, stable inventories. A matching container ID is preserved and reconciled; no match is a no-effect proof only when the complete inventory is authoritative. Any ambiguity, started container, missing identity, or incomplete inventory remains `effect_unknown`; never replay the create.

Historical uncertain runs were abandoned by operator decision; no reconciliation or migration is required. Do not infer recovery from old records. Restart the runner only after any current inspection is recorded.

For the authorized host-removal procedure for retired AO components, see [AO host removal](ao-host-removal.md). It is a separate runbook and has not been executed.

## Voice gateway

The separately deployed gateway is the Zoe-compatible fork
[ronigooja/chatgpt-web-voice](https://github.com/ronigooja/chatgpt-web-voice).
Pin `VOICE_GATEWAY_REVISION` to an immutable fork commit for production.
See [the deployment instructions](../../deploy/voice/README.md).

- The management URL is deployment-specific; do not assume a host name or
  LAN address from this document. Keep management access on an operator-managed
  trusted path.
- Source: `/opt/zoe/voice/upstream`.
- Container: `zoe-voice-gateway`.
- Persistent data: `/var/lib/zoe/voice`.
- Compose configuration: `/etc/zoe/voice.compose.yaml`.
- Private environment: `/etc/zoe/voice.env`.
- Management login reference: `/etc/zoe/voice-admin.txt`, on Linux only.

The user must manually import a ChatGPT Web account in the gateway management
UI. Deploying the gateway does not establish voice functionality in Zoe:
trusted HTTPS, client media permissions, and voice acceptance remain required.
The optional Zoe account-media integration is not part of the current baseline;
keep it disabled until a future gateway revision and its lifecycle contract
have passed a separate architecture review and the applicable acceptance
checks.

## Operator CLI deployment metadata

The `zoe` operator CLI reads deployment metadata without opening secret files.
Its status view reports the detected systemd or Compose mode, service states,
provider endpoint and model, the source of provider configuration, the last
provider check category, and the secret file mode. Token contents, instance
keys, and complete installation links are never included in status output.

The canonical OpenCode provider variables are `ZOE_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`, `ZOE_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_KEY_FILE`, and `ZOE_OPENCODE_MODEL`; the runtime image and bridge use `ZOE_OPENCODE_IMAGE` and `ZOE_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_SOCKET`. The default key file is `/etc/zoe/runner-secrets/cliproxyapi-api-key` with mode `0600`. Provider credentials never enter the OpenCode container environment. The memory model key file `/etc/zoe/secrets/mem0-llm-api-key` is owned by `65532:65532`, like the other Compose secrets.


Service reloads are performed by the CLI through the detected deployment
manager. For systemd it runs `daemon-reload` followed by
`reload-or-restart` for the affected units. For Compose it runs the configured
project with `docker compose up -d --no-build`. A failed command is returned to
the caller so setup can retain the previous configuration and report a
rollback-safe failure.

Run `zoe` without arguments for the interactive operator menu. The key
initialization and rotation entries ask for the server URL, then display the
key and `zoe://connect` installation link once. The built-in QR encoder
renders the same link in the terminal for App scanning; no `qrencode` host
dependency is required. Keep this terminal private because the QR grants access. Status never
prints keys, tokens, or installation links.

## Operator release installation

The Linux workflow's manual release option builds the `zoe` operator CLI for
Linux `amd64` and `arm64` on GitHub-hosted runners after its complete checks pass;
see [CI verification](../development/verification.md#completion-gate-and-manual-checks).
Each `operator-linux-<arch>-<revision>` artifact contains
a tarball with `bin/zoe`, `deploy-linux/install-cli.sh`, `SOURCE_REVISION`, and
`SHA256SUMS`. Select the host architecture, extract into a new immutable release
directory, and verify `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` from that directory. This operator
archive does not contain the server images or a complete service deployment.

For a complete source-built release, `deploy/linux/build-release.sh RELEASE_TAG`
also installs `bin/zoe` beside the runner in `/opt/zoe/releases/RELEASE_TAG`.
Builds must run in CI or an authorized worker, not on the controller. After
reviewing the release, install its CLI on the standard host PATH with:

```sh
sudo bash /opt/zoe/releases/RELEASE_TAG/deploy-linux/install-cli.sh /opt/zoe/releases/RELEASE_TAG
zoe
```

The installer atomically selects the immutable CLI through `/usr/local/bin/zoe`
and refuses to overwrite an existing regular file. It does not start services
or alter external CLIProxyAPI. Run `zoe status` to inspect deployment metadata
before setup or provider changes. The release staging and PATH tests use fake
build tools and temporary paths; Go unit/integration/race checks, actual binary
builds, Apple builds, and physical-device scanning have separate evidence.
For deployment and physical-device evidence, use the [acceptance evidence register](../acceptance/evidence.md).

## Native client installation and connection

Install reviewed CI artifacts with the applicable platform signing/provisioning. Keep Mac inputs, signing/install scripts, artifacts, and logs under `~/Developer/Zoe/runs/<task-id>/`; the installed application belongs at `/Applications/Zoe.app`. A launch/signature check establishes installation only. See [Apple module instructions](../../clients/apple/README.md) and [current evidence](../acceptance/evidence.md) for tested revisions and remaining device/distribution gates.

The current client accepts an operator-selected server URL and shared instance key stored only in Keychain. The exact QR/link interaction is defined in [product](../product.md#3-client-requirements). Use HTTPS across an untrusted network; HTTP exposes the key in transit. Key initialization/rotation requires the server's exclusive database lock; stop it first. Rotation preserves the fixed owner/workspace, tasks, and separate worker credentials. Remove any legacy `ZOE_INSTANCE_KEY` or instance-key secret-map configuration before restart; the canonical Compose deployment does not inject a plaintext owner key. Restart closes old streams. Clearing a client removes its local data, not the shared key or durable tasks.

For export, backup, migration, restore, and destruction, use [data lifecycle operations](data-lifecycle.md).

## Deployment candidates and rollback

A deployment candidate is a reviewed release manifest plus the immutable artifacts
named by that manifest. Generate and inspect its plan before transferring files:

```sh
deploy/linux/deployment-candidate.sh RELEASE_MANIFEST.json \
  --compose deploy/linux/docker-compose.yml \
  --env-file /path/to/reviewed/zoe-stack.env \
  --output deployment-plan.json
```

This command is read-only. It verifies the source revision, architecture, every
artifact SHA-256 and optional image digest, and the rendered Compose configuration.
It prints an explicit order: verify hashes, install OpenCode runtime and the immutable Zoe
release, switch `/opt/zoe/releases/current`, then start and check services. The
plan records the previous immutable release and image digests as rollback targets.
It never contacts a host, changes a selector, pulls an image, or starts a service.

On the host, apply the reviewed plan manually. Keep old immutable release
 directories and image tags. Rollback changes only the `current` selector and
Compose image tags, then repeats `/healthz`, `/readyz`, runner/OpenCode/Qdrant, and
independent task checks. Record integrity, installation, readiness, connectivity,
and end-to-end results separately; see the [acceptance evidence register](../acceptance/evidence.md)
for the acceptance boundary. This does not modify the external CLIProxyAPI deployment.
